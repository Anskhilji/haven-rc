SINGLE FAMILY RENTALSIn 2010, Haven Realty Capital recognized an opportunity to acquire, stabilize, lease and manage distressed residential properties in working class neighborhoods. The strategy has provided a valid financial opportunity due to strong yield metrics and realized value appreciation.  Equally as important, execution of the strategy aided in the stabilization of local neighborhoods and provided a viable and effective solution to the U.S. housing crisis.Since inception, Haven Realty Capital has acquired, renovated and stabilized 1,500+ single family rental homes as a principal owner and has third party managed approximately 10,000 single family rental homes across seven states.
